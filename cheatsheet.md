## Tutorial
Below is the tutorial that the users get once they execute the game. 

Welcome to <Pawpularity: The Road To Debut>!
You are now a manager of a meowdol (meow + idol), who is a cat idol trainee.
You need to train your meowdol so they can debut!
Your meowdol's talent is determined by their danceEXP, vocalEXP, attractiveness, and fame.
You have many ways to increase these EXPs!
Your skills must be higher than 400 for every section to debut.
What you can do are the followings:
* Make your meowdol take dance and vocal lessons at the academy to increase danceEXP and vocalEXP
* Take your meowdol to the clothing store or the beauty salon to increase their attractiveness
* Take your meowdol to the gym to exercise and increase their attractiveness
* Make your meowdol film TV shows or shoot advertisements at the studio to earn pawrency (pawrency is the currency in Pawpularity world!)
* Make your meowdol record radio programs at the radio station to earn pawrency
* Make your meowdol compete with other meowdols at competitions to increase fame
* Make your meowdol wear the clothes they bought at the clothing store or sleep to move on to the next day at home.

IMPORTANT NOTE: There are limits on how many times you can do these activities a day; your meowdol should go to sleep to get more training!

Phew! That was a lot of explanation. I still have several things left to tell you! Please keep up.
You can't just train you meowdol at your house; You and your meowdol should walk to where you want to go!
The buildings and your position are marked on the map, and you can see your map when you choose to go outside.
The buildings are indicated as initials.
